The Ultimate NoFollow SEO WordPress plugin allows you to add NoFollow tags to links site-wide based on the base url(http://somesite.com), CSS Class & ID, and HTML Tag. There's finally a simple all-in-one solution that lets you manage all your NoFollow links in one place. Create new noFollow links, edit old ones, and delete the ones you don't need. This works perfectly for links that repeat throughout your site that don't need a rel="follow" tag.

== Description ==
Add the NoFollow tag to any link on your webpage from one simple dashboard. Define what links are affected by html elements or css selectors. Stay Google compliant!
If you are looking to build your site's rank in a natural and Google approved method, you know the value of having certain links set to NoFollow. But going back over your site with a fine toothed comb can be a trying and painstaking process. Especially, if you've got a lot of content built over the years. With the increasing importance of telling the search engines if they should consider a link worth following, it's now more important than ever to get a handle on your outbound links.

> Wikipedia - nofollow:
> nofollowÂ is a value that can be assigned to the rel attribute of an HTML an element to instruct some search engines that the hyperlink should not influence the ranking of the link's target in the search engine's index.

Agencies are often hired to help get it under control. So, whether you are an agency working for clients, or a site owner wanting to avoid the expense of an Agency, the Ultimate SEO NoFollow plugin will allow you to craft the link profile Google, Bing, Yahoo and others are looking for, without breaking the bank. This lightweight plugin will let you setup one or more rules to apply across your site on how to tag the links already on your site, as well as those you will add in the future.

Other typical use cases include links created by 3rd party commenters on blogs, affiliate product links, consulting or agency links, or links the author wishes to point to, but avoid endorsing.

#### Example Case Study:
You've been building content over time, including several affiliate links to products. By setting up a "rule" to target the base URL for your affiliate links, you can set the plugin to automatically go find those and add the all-important rel="nofollow" to links buried on your site in long forgotten (but still active) posts, pages, sidebars and footers.

#### Example Case Study:
You're an agency that has created websites for dozens of clients over the last 5 years and many of those sites have grown to hundreds or even thousands of pages. Each has a link back to you in the footer. Google has begun to penalize you for those thousands of inbound links.


#### Installation Instructions
Download the zip file from the WordPress repo, or search and install the plugin from the Plugin Add New feature in WordPress.

Once installed you can setup the rule(s) for the turning all footer links to your agency website over to rel="nofollow" except for the link on the home page. You can also setup just links within a certain HTML tag, class or ID. You can optionally set it to NOT do all links within a class (reverse option).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can I set all footer links to nofollow, except on the homepage? =
Yes, absolutely. In fact, that's why we started building this plugin. As a marketing agency building a lot of client websites, assets, and web properties, we realized our own SEO efforts were being negatively affected by putting our link in the footer. We decided that the homepage link should be the only normal follow link. All others should be nofollo to adhere to Google's Best Practices.
